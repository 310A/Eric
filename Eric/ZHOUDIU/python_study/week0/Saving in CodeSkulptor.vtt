00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:07.305
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:10.011
So, at this point in the class, we've 
introduced you to CodeSkulptor, and we've 

3
00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:13.580
shown you a little bit of Python. 
However, we haven't shown you how to save 

4
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.571
anything. 
So, if every time you go back to 

5
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:18.653
CodeSkulptor, you have to retype in your 
work, that's going to get really tedious, 

6
00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:21.441
really fast. 
So, today, we're going to talk about 

7
00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:24.346
saving things and how to get them back 
into CodeSkulptor. 

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.930
Okay. 
Let's head over to CodeSkulptor. 

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.367
Here we are. 
And for the purposes of today, I don't 

10
00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:34.090
want to use the example program. 
Instead I just want to type my own. 

11
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.079
[SOUND] It's my first program. 
Print, hello. 

12
00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.077
Right? 
I've got this fantastic program. 

13
00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:45.570
I run it. 
Does what I expect. 

14
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.592
Now I want to save it because I'm happy 
with it. 

15
00:00:47.592 --> 00:00:50.084
Well, how do I do that? 
You can see up here in the control par-, 

16
00:00:50.084 --> 00:00:53.630
part of the application that there is an 
icon with a disk. 

17
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.070
And that is the Save button. 
I pushed it. 

18
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.290
Looks like nothing happened. 
Well, actually, something did happen. 

19
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.904
The address in the address bar is 
changed. 

20
00:01:02.904 --> 00:01:06.616
And if you look up here, you can see that 
now at the end of the URL, is this 

21
00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:11.890
hashtag and its filename. 
This filename was randomly generated for 

22
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.836
you. 
This now names your file in the Cloud. 

23
00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:18.709
When you push the Save button, your file 
is sent off to the Cloud. 

24
00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:22.485
A new randomly generated filename is, is 
created for you, and it is part of the 

25
00:01:22.485 --> 00:01:25.686
URL. 
So, this URL will now, and until the end 

26
00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:28.843
of the class, name your file. 
Okay? 

27
00:01:28.843 --> 00:01:32.540
So what does that mean? 
It means I can copy this URL. 

28
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.330
I can create a new tab. 
I can paste it. 

29
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.168
Let's load this. 
And, hey, we got our program back. 

30
00:01:38.168 --> 00:01:40.662
Okay? 
So, if I lose my program, say, we go back 

31
00:01:40.662 --> 00:01:43.954
to CodeSkulptor it's gone. 
All right. 

32
00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:47.660
Well, it's not really gone, okay? 
I can paste this back. 

33
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.340
However, that filename was randomly 
generated. 

34
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.850
We don't know what it is. 
So, only you know what it is. 

35
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.200
You need to keep track of it. 
If you lose it, it's gone. 

36
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.492
All right? 
So, how can I keep track of it? 

37
00:02:00.492 --> 00:02:02.360
Well, there are several ways. 
Okay. 

38
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.880
One, you could bookmark it. 
Two, you could look in the history of 

39
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.179
your browser. 
Three, you could copy it and save it into 

40
00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.360
a file on your computer. 
Four, you could email it to yourself. 

41
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.408
And I'm sure there are many other ways 
that you could come up with to keep track 

42
00:02:15.408 --> 00:02:17.171
of your filenames. 
All right? 

43
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:20.801
So, you should do whatever you find most 
comfortable but you absolutely need to 

44
00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:23.106
save these filenames. 
Okay? 

45
00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:27.572
And I'm going to show you on Chrome, 
there's this little star button over 

46
00:02:27.572 --> 00:02:30.919
here. 
I can push that and it will put a 

47
00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.258
bookmark. 
So, I'm going to call it hello program. 

48
00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:36.810
I'm going to put it in the bookmarks bar, 
say done. 

49
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.060
And here it the/g, here it is. 
It shows up on the bookmarks bar. 

50
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.985
If you don't have a bookmarks bar, you 
should go through the menus, I'm sure you 

51
00:02:41.985 --> 00:02:43.830
can find it. 
Okay? 

52
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.752
And when I push this and it doesn't 
matter where I am. 

53
00:02:46.752 --> 00:02:49.714
Let's open up a new tab. 
I push this and all of a sudden my 

54
00:02:49.714 --> 00:02:51.783
program comes back. 
Okay? 

55
00:02:51.783 --> 00:02:55.111
So, it is critically important that you 
keep track of these URL's, so that you 

56
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:58.294
can get your files back. 
I don't want to go through all the 

57
00:02:58.294 --> 00:03:00.790
possible ways that you can manage your 
bookmarks. 

58
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.328
You can use Google to find out about 
that. 

59
00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:05.624
All right? 
But make sure that you do so. 

60
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.754
Okay. 
So, you've written your very important 

61
00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:12.680
program and you've saved it to the Cloud 
and we push the, the Save button. 

62
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.236
We are very comfortable that our file has 
been saved but to be really cautious, we 

63
00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:21.730
should download it to our local computer 
as well. 

64
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.560
You really want a copy for yourself, not 
just relying on the Cloud. 

65
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.817
Okay? 
You could lose the URL, you could lose 

66
00:03:27.817 --> 00:03:30.969
something else. 
And downloading, okay, by pushing 

67
00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:35.109
Download button right here, gets the file 
that you most recently saved to the Cloud 

68
00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.144
and it brings it back to your local 
computer. 

69
00:03:39.144 --> 00:03:40.839
Okay. 
So, this button is only going to be 

70
00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.608
active right after you hit the Save 
button. 

71
00:03:43.608 --> 00:03:46.598
Now, your web browser recognizes that 
this is a Python program, and so it gives 

72
00:03:46.598 --> 00:03:50.444
you a warning, Hey, this program could 
run and harm your computer. 

73
00:03:50.444 --> 00:03:53.836
Well, it's a program that you wrote, it's 
not going to harm your computer, so you 

74
00:03:53.836 --> 00:03:56.968
can ignore this and keep it. 
All right? 

75
00:03:56.968 --> 00:03:59.967
We've now downloaded our program. 
Okay. 

76
00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:04.620
We can actually open the Downloads folder 
and here we go. 

77
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.410
You can see that I have two files that 
I've downloaded in the past. 

78
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.389
All right? 
And I can actually open them and you can 

79
00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.290
look at it in Notepad and here is my 
program. 

80
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.692
So, now I have some extra security. 
And we strongly recommend that after you 

81
00:04:17.692 --> 00:04:21.346
get a working program or after you're 
done working in a particular session, 

82
00:04:21.346 --> 00:04:26.949
that you both bookmark the file and you 
download it to your local machine. 

83
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.020
Now, saving your files is only useful if 
you can actually get them back. 

84
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.452
So, if you copy the URL, either into your 
own file or just copied it, you can paste 

85
00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:39.200
it back into the address bar and get your 
file back. 

86
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.030
If you bookmarked your URL, then you can 
get it back, by using the bookmarks. 

87
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.080
Okay? 
If you forgot to bookmark, you can 

88
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.640
actually use your History in Chrome. 
That's Ctrl+H. 

89
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.050
And you can see all these exciting 
Codes-, CodeSkulptor files I've worked 

90
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.223
on. 
Right. 

91
00:04:54.223 --> 00:04:56.159
You push this. 
You can get something back. 

92
00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.850
hey that's not the one I wanted. 
I can keep searching. 

93
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.775
Hey, here's another one okay. 
Okay. 

94
00:05:00.775 --> 00:05:04.285
And you can probably find pretty much 
everything you've done in your History, 

95
00:05:04.285 --> 00:05:07.742
all right? 
Now, what if I downloaded the file 

96
00:05:07.742 --> 00:05:10.714
locally? 
Okay, so here I am at CodeSkulptor, and I 

97
00:05:10.714 --> 00:05:14.420
had previously downloaded my file. 
That's where this Open Local button 

98
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.942
comes. 
If I use the open button, I can navigate 

99
00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:21.590
through my hard drive. 
I can find the file that I care about. 

100
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.850
And I can open it, and here it is. 
Okay? 

101
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.216
So, you can use one of these mechanisms 
to retrieve the files that you've saved, 

102
00:05:29.216 --> 00:05:32.572
depending on how you decided to actually 
save it. 

103
00:05:32.572 --> 00:05:36.407
Now, it's never going to be the case that 
you type your program in one shot, you're 

104
00:05:36.407 --> 00:05:40.020
done, you save it, and you submit it, 
okay? 

105
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.108
Programming is an incremental process. 
So, here I wrote my program, I said, 

106
00:05:44.108 --> 00:05:47.035
print hello. 
I said, oh wait, I was trying to write, 

107
00:05:47.035 --> 00:05:48.835
hello world. 
Okay. 

108
00:05:48.835 --> 00:05:52.955
I'm on, hey much better. 
I Save that. 

109
00:05:52.955 --> 00:05:56.289
wait a minute. 
I like exclamation points. 

110
00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.962
There's not enough of them. 
All right, let's Save that. 

111
00:05:59.962 --> 00:06:01.754
Oh, wait. 
Let me run that again. 

112
00:06:01.754 --> 00:06:04.859
No, that's not really what I wanted. 
I wanted this. 

113
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.320
Okay? 
And you keep going,okay? 

114
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.340
Eventually, you get to something that 
you're happy with. 

115
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.130
You say, okay, this is the program I 
want. 

116
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.350
You go off and submit it or whatever, 
okay? 

117
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.315
I want you to notice, though, while 
you're doing that, if you keep saving, 

118
00:06:19.315 --> 00:06:23.215
that the name of your file basically 
stays the same, except this version 

119
00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:28.520
number at the end, increments. 
It started out at zero, then it went to 

120
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.810
one, two, three, four, and this is 
somewhat convenient. 

121
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.476
You can actually go back in time while 
you're working in a session, you keep 

122
00:06:34.476 --> 00:06:37.381
saving. 
You say, oh, I screwed up and I overwrote 

123
00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:40.303
things. 
You can just, even if you didn't bookmark 

124
00:06:40.303 --> 00:06:44.073
them, you can change that number and say, 
oh, I really meant to use that program 

125
00:06:44.073 --> 00:06:47.852
one back. 
And hey, it goes back to my program with 

126
00:06:47.852 --> 00:06:51.347
all the exclamation points. 
Okay, so the version number you might 

127
00:06:51.347 --> 00:06:54.047
find that relatively convenient way of 
going back in time and looking at 

128
00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:57.570
previous versions while you've been 
sitting there working. 

129
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.480
Okay, as you can see, I've been working 
hard on my hello world program here. 

130
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.835
And I finally got it the way I want it 
and I'm ready to submit it to Coursera, 

131
00:07:05.835 --> 00:07:09.465
to send it to all my friends and family, 
and basically show off my, that coolness 

132
00:07:09.465 --> 00:07:14.850
of all of my work, all right? 
You can just use the URL that you have 

133
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.071
here and that's perfectly fine. 
But you'll notice hey, this is the lucky 

134
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:22.431
number 13 version of my, my file and 
maybe I don't want people to be able to 

135
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:28.320
look back through the history, and see 
what happened in version number 6, okay? 

136
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.660
So, we added a little suitcase button. 
When you push the suitcase button, it 

137
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.128
generates a new filename for you. 
So, it does everything that the save 

138
00:07:35.128 --> 00:07:38.026
button does, it just doesn't have a 
version number. 

139
00:07:38.026 --> 00:07:40.672
Now, if you'd like, you can use this to 
submit to Coursera, you can use this to 

140
00:07:40.672 --> 00:07:44.360
send to your friends and family and they 
can't see all the versions. 

141
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.100
There's nothing wrong with the version 
numbers, this is just your choice. 

142
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.038
There's one final thing I want to call 
you attention to. 

143
00:07:50.038 --> 00:07:53.029
And that is the prefix of the filename 
right here, okay? 

144
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:56.431
Now, you can see that it's user1 here, 
but if you go to CodeSkulptor right now 

145
00:07:56.431 --> 00:08:00.510
and save, I guarantee you that it's not 
going to be user1. 

146
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.570
So, you guys are going to generate 
hundreds of thousands of files a week and 

147
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.441
this prefix helps us keep those files 
manageable, all right? 

148
00:08:07.441 --> 00:08:11.534
So, we change this every once in a while. 
We will change it in time, at times that 

149
00:08:11.534 --> 00:08:15.570
are not so disruptive, but do be aware 
that that could change, okay? 

150
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:19.332
And if it changes your version numbers 
will just keep incrementing. 

151
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:23.957
So, you, here I have User 1, Version 3. 
If I hit Save and we had changed that to 

152
00:08:23.957 --> 00:08:27.180
User 2, it would go to User 2 Version 4, 
okay? 

153
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.618
Another thing I want to call your 
attention to is the dashes in the 

154
00:08:29.618 --> 00:08:32.318
filename. 
They might be dashes, they might 

155
00:08:32.318 --> 00:08:35.398
underbars, okay. 
Don't worry about that, that's not a big 

156
00:08:35.398 --> 00:08:37.512
deal. 
So, we've now shown you that using 

157
00:08:37.512 --> 00:08:40.776
CodeSkulptor, you can save your files to 
the cloud, and then you can download them 

158
00:08:40.776 --> 00:08:44.861
back to your local hard drive. 
You need to do this early and often, 

159
00:08:44.861 --> 00:08:47.413
okay? 
As you're working, make sure that you 

160
00:08:47.413 --> 00:08:50.214
save, all right? 
And when you're done working, either 

161
00:08:50.214 --> 00:08:53.030
because you finished your program or 
you're tired of working at the computer 

162
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.758
for now and you're going to walk away, 
make sure at that point you bookmark and 

163
00:08:55.758 --> 00:08:59.390
you download the file to your local 
computer. 

164
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.044
This will make sure that you can always 
get it back. 

165
00:09:02.044 --> 00:09:05.210
Remember, we cannot recover those URLs 
for you. 

166
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.053
If you lose the URL, we don't know it's 
yours, we can't find it, we can't get it 

167
00:09:09.053 --> 00:09:12.876
back. 
If you keep the URL, however, you can get 

168
00:09:12.876 --> 00:09:15.573
it back. 
And you can use that URL to submit it to 

169
00:09:15.573 --> 00:09:18.112
Coursera. 
You can use that URL to send to your 

170
00:09:18.112 --> 00:09:20.526
friends. 
Marvel at the wonderful work that you've 

171
00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:23.232
been doing in this class and generally 
enjoy yourself. 

172
00:09:23.232 --> 00:09:25.447
Okay? 
We promise that we will save all these 

173
00:09:25.447 --> 00:09:28.540
files in the Cloud throughout the class. 
All right? 

174
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.520
But it's your responsibility to track the 
URL's. 

175
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.573
With that, I hope you have a lot of fun 
in this class.
